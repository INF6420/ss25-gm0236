         <br>
         <br>
       <p>ABN Antioch is an Old-time Radio Shows station<br>
        <br>located in Antioch, IL,<br>
        <br>a mile from the Wisconsin border<br>
        <br>and 20 miles inland from Lake Michigan<br>
        <br> currently transmitting at 1610KHz.<br>
        <br>
        <br>The AM transmitter is a micro-power<br>
        <br>part15 AM RangeMaster1000 transmitter.<br>
        <br>
        <br>Range is very limited due to just 100mW of power<br>
        <br>and competition with many distant stations<br>
        <br>but it is sufficient for all the antique<br>
        <br>and crystal radios in the house<br>
        <br>and can be heard well by the near neighbors<br>
        <br>
        <br>(...if they care).</p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>About 16,000 shows are reviewed<br> 
    <br>and approved<br>
    <br>to be automatically scheduled<br> 
    <br>out of the whole library<br>
    <br>which has about 70,000 as mp3<br>
    <br>and about 30,000 on reel tape<br>
    <br>with considerable duplication between the two.<br>
    <br>
    <br>The source of the playout<br> 
    <br>runs on an M1 Mac Mini<br>
    <br>which has the job of scheduling and <br>
    <br>playing all shows.<br>
    <br>Scheduling playlists<br> 
    <br>and voice work concatenation<br>
    <br>is done by custom in-house software<br>
    <br>RADIOLOGIK OTR<br>
    <br>which I first created in 2003.<br>
    <br>
        <br>It uses Apple's Music app<br> 
        <br>for the library and playlists,<br>
        <br>Radiologik DJ for the playing of audio,<br>
        <br>and Audio HiJack for the audio processing,<br>
        <br>mp3 encoding<br>
        <br>and sending to the server.</p>  
        <br>

         <h2 id="Library"><p><strong class="small-strong">Library Selection</strong></p></h2>
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
<p>Collections are merged from various sources.<br><br>
    <br>As of 2018, these sources include<br> 
    <br>recently digitized reel tapes.<br><br>
    <br>From that I compare and make judgements<br>
    <br>on air-worthiness,<br>
    <br>fix and adjust audio to remove hum,<br>
    <br>reduce hiss, trim, speed-correct, and EQ.<br><br>
    <br>I confirm and identify and correct episode names,<br>
    <br>dates and spellings where I can.<br><br>
    <br>Some misspellings by other collectors<br>
    <br>get past me sometimes.<br><br>
    <br>Some collectors have already done<br>
    <br>their own noise reduction<br>
    <br>giving a very artificial artifacted sound or gating.<br>
    <br>For audio quality,<br>
    <br>I prefer hearing some surface noise<br>
    <br>to a loss of fidelity and I'd sometimes prefer<br>
    <br>a more complete show if the audio is a little worse<br>
    <br>and sometimes I'll even merge two files into one.<br><br>
    <br>When I do noise reduction<br>
    <br>I try to make sure it doesn't become distracting.<br>
    <br>
    <br>People's ears can adjust to a constant noise.<br><br>
    <br>When I get a chance,<br>
    <br>I replace these if I have a better copy digitially<br>
     <br>or get the chance to get it myself from the reels.<br><br>
     <br>Large collections take years to listen to<br>
     <br>so this is an ongoing process.<br><br>
     <br>But I spot check everything by listening<br>
    <br>to the first 30 seconds,<br>
    <br>sampling several places in the middle<br>
    <br>and listening to the end.<br><br>
    <br>I sometimes have to remove<br>
    <br>long annoying 30 second to 2 minute<br>
    <br>trailing silence.<br><br>
    <br>I've often done pitch corrections<br>
    <br>and careful noise reduction where I can<br>
    <br>to remove clicks and narrowband noise<br>
     <br>such as hum using notch filters<br>
     <br>and low and high cut filters<br>
     <br>but where I have control over it<br>
     <br>I'm careful not to make noise reduction a distraction<br>
     <br>such as with heavy noise gates.</p><br><br>
     <br>

<p>Getting a large collection isn't too difficult.<br>
    <br>
    <br>It's the work of sorting out a collection<br>
    <br>from multiple sources that takes a lot of time.<br>
    <br>
    <br>Even from the best "HQ" sources<br>
    <br>there can be problems<br>
    <br>so having more than one HQ source<br> 
    <br>is an advantage.<br>
    <br>
    <br>From the more commonly available mp3 sources<br>
    <br>I've heard the worst examples of<br>
    <br>very bad decisions at the digital stage<br>
    <br>such as encoding stereo at a mono bit rate<br>
    <br>like 32Kbps stereo 22KHz sampling.<br>
    <br>
    <br> I've heard noise reduction techniques that<br>
    <br>make things sound underwater.<br>
    <br>
     <br>I've heard AOL sign-in<br> 
     <br>and Windows desktop sounds<br>
     <br>(just lovely and embarrassing to hear played on a Mac).<br>
     <br>
     <br>I've heard mp3 encoding glitches<br> 
     <br>that sound like hiccups.<br>
     <br>
     <br>I've heard large amounts of leading<br>
     <br>and trailing silence<br>
     <br>which is like counting rings on a tree<br>
     <br>as I hear the different hiss sounds of<br>
     <br>many generations of tape recordings.<br>
     <br>
     <br>I've encountered lots of missing ID3 tags.<br>
     <br>
      <br>I've encountered duplicate files just with<br> 
      <br>different file names<br>
      <br>claiming to be an episode they're not.<br>
      <br>
      <br>I've heard audio drop-outs consistently<br>
      <br>every few seconds<br>
      <br>for an entire 900-show Suspense collection.</p><br>

         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
         <p>Scheduling of shows is an automated process<br>
            <br>where shows are selected by the following priority:<br>
            <br>

    <br>1. Shows that match today's date<br> 
    <br>that have not played recently<br>
    <br>
    <br>2. Shows that match today's date<br> 
    <br>regardless of when they last played<br>
    <br>
    <br>3. Shows that match yesterday's date<br> 
    <br>that haven't played recently<br>
    <br>
    <br>4. Shows that match the day<br>
    <br>before yesterday's date<br> 
    <br>that haven't played recently<br>
    <br>
    <br>5. Randomly selected shows<br> 
    <br>that haven't played recently.</p><br>
    <br>

<p>Where recently = a few months<br>
    <br>to a few years<br> 
    <br>depending on category.<br>
    <br>
    <br>In the case of Comedy shows,<br> 
    <br>this can be 2 to 3 years<br>
    <br>whereas with Spy Stories<br> 
    <br>it can be just a couple months.<br>
    <br>
    <br> Serials just rotate.</p><br>
    <br>

<br><p>The dates are read as<br> 
    <br>a date object<br> 
    <br>and audio is concatenated<br>
     <br>to present an introduction of<br> 
     <br>original play date<br> 
     <br>including the day of the week.</p><br>
     <br>
     <p> Station IDs and an<br> 
        <br>"Up Next"<br>
         <br>file are compiled<br> 
         <br>along with music fill.</p><br>
         <br>

<p>Since we're matching today's date<br>
    <br>and since most of you<br> 
    <br>don't stay awake listening<br> 
    <br>for 24 hours,<br> 
    <br>there are replays of several<br>
     <br>sub-genre segments across the day<br> 
     <br>so you don't have to worry<br> 
     <br>about missing much.</p><br>
     <br>

<p>When there's room at the end of a segment,<br> 
    <br>we fill with public domain<br> 
    <br>classical music from <a href="https://musopen.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">musopen.com</a>.<br>
    <br>
    <br>Music track lengths that perfectly<br>
    <br>fit the fill time needed<br> 
    <br>are used when possible.</p>
